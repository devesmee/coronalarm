# Coronalarm
CoronAlarm is an application that notifies people when they are within 1.5 meters of someone else with the app. This to remind them to keep the distance now that Covid cases are rising once again. This application was developed in Kotlin and runs on Android devices.


**Plays a sound when too close**

A sound chosen by yourself is played whenever you are within a 1.5 metres distance of someone else with the CoronAlarm app. Reminding both you and the other person to keep your distance from each other.


**Record your own sounds**

It is possible to record customized sounds and use them as your CoronAlarm.


**Turn on-and-off**

The alarm can easily be turned on-and-off in case you are on public transport or at home where the alarm is not needed.
